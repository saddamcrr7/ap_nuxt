        "text":"Discovery Land Company specializes in building luxury private club communities throughout the world. We were commissioned to create an immersive, emotive and highly engaging user experience that showcases its international portfolio and drives real-estate sales. The site also had to be highly scalable acting as a portal to all 23 properties and future sites. Along with creating an entirely new design system for the corporate brand and all future sites we also implemented and deployed a new technology framework. Working with Discovery and chosen partners this new framework allowed for a more agile and scalable workflow while improving overall performance. In order to resonate with the target audience, we focused the creative and content on memorable moments in an immersive user experience. To do this, we came up with the theme of “Discover your world,” which ran through the entire creative process."
