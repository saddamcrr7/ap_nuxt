        My experience across multiple disciplines especially advertising<br />
        has helped me approach websites with a more strategic and<br />
        holistic view. I firmly believe that in order to successfully engage<br />
        and resonate with your audience you must not only<br />
        communicate a powerful story but you must create a<br />
        memorable and lasting experience.<br />
